🌌 About Me

A developer with discipline, vision, and a touch of chaos (the good kind).

🧠 I Build. I Break. I Improve.

I’m a developer who enjoys creating systems that are smooth, stable, and smart.
I love when code is clean, architecture is beautiful, and performance is sharp.

I’m the type of person who will rewrite a function three times
— not because it’s broken,
but because it can be better.
